## 🎧 Reverb & Impulse Response

Reverb only works when a `.wav` impulse response is provided. Without it, the reverb will not function — no sound will be heard if it's enabled with an empty buffer.

You can import your own `.wav` files (mono or stereo), or use this file with 134 impulse responses included:  
🧷 File not included by default for size reasons.

Recommended external IR packs:

  These range from 196MB to 409MB — too large to embed by default.

## 🎵 SoundFonts & MIDI

⚠️ SoundFonts may sound unusually quiet. Some `.sf2` files send instruments to reverb processors at only 11%, 5%, or even 1% volume.  
This is **not a bug**, it's the original design of the soundfont.

To mitigate this, the app includes a **toggle** to adjust how these effects are handled when they are activated in the effects window. You will find a button, either green or red and wihtout icon to activate / deactivate the inputs from `.sf2` files and only care about _your_ inputs.

You can import your own `.sf2` files, but some are too large to be saved persistently. Files under 20MB are saved; larger files must be pinned manually in IndexedDB.

Those are the best I came up with (and I heard about the airfont that are apparently really good) but if you want to check it by yourself the best place to do so (for me) is on the WayBack Machine (but you can surely find SoundFonts else where by yourself if you want to!):

> Fully compatible with SoundFont 2 specs !!

## 🔊 ADSR Behavior

- `.sf2` notes automatically receive a basic ADSR envelope on load.
- Real recorded piano notes already include their natural decay.
- When you apply your own ADSR, it **layers on top** of the existing one.
- This can cause unusual results but is usually subtle and acceptable.

The same applies to the **dynamic release** system: it's intentionally basic, and timing may not feel 100% natural.

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (not tooltipped)

Some controls are accessible via keyboard as shortcuts.

So when you are on the effects window you can control theses settings via your keyboard when you're on the concerned window:

- **Volume panel**: `↑ ↓` to increase/decrease volume
- **Panoramic knob**: `W A S D` to move the panner
- **Toggle Effects**: `Enter` or `Space` to enable/disable:
  - Sustain
  - Reverb
  - Chorus
  - ADSR
  - Echo
  - Distortion

## 📱 Compatibility Notice

⚠️ Not usable on mobile — the screen is too small, and there's no hover interaction on certain buttons.  
You can still play basic piano notes, but for the full experience, please use a computer.
If you want to have a piano on your phone, check the first version which was just a simple piano but with way less features, so it's clearly better for you if you just want to play with a basic piano.

🛠️ Tested on:  
> **Laptop model**: Inspiron 14 5435 (Windows 11, Chrome)  
> Not tested on other systems, so bug reports are welcome!

## 📦 Storage & Limits

- 🎵 Last **10 MIDI files played** (max 500KB each) are cached
- 🎶 Last **5 `.mid` files loaded** (max 500KB each)
- 🥁 Last **5 `.sf2` files loaded** (max 20MB each)
- 🎧 Last **5 `.wav` impulse files** (max 5MB each)
- ✅ Large files can be "pinned" manually to persist in IndexedDB

## 🧹 Code Notes

- Many features were added incrementally → logic may be messy
- Variable names are inconsistent in places (you try naming 2,174 variables!)
- Some features interrupt others — sorry in advance!
- Icons used from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (free tier)
