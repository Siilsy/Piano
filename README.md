## ‚å®Ô∏è Inputs
It's a bit hard but you'll understand very fast how it work.

You can do everything only with your mouse so it's pretty easy, no ?

I have 88 keys on my piano but on a normal keyboard there doesn't have so much keys. So i had to assign 4 octaves to deal with and assign each octave 12 keys on my keyboard. To change the selectionnated octaves, you can press the first 9 digits. There are 9 octaves from 0 to 8, so the digits from 1 to 9 fit perfectly ! 

The keyboard keys for the piano are displayed to be for a 'QWERTY' keyboard, but it doesn't matter of YOUR keyboard. If you are in 'AZERTY', you just have to remember that the displayed 'Q' on a piano key is actually the 'A' on your keyboard.

I had to find the 48 keyboard keys I needed and it's not easy so I sometimes used rare keys. And by default, the keys are strange and it can be disturbing but you have the 'Assignment Button' which is a cog to change the keys. You can also press the 'Delete' button to activate the mode. You will be able to selection a note to attribute it a new key. You can also put different piano keys on an only keyboard key to play a chord. If you want to to do a song with a certain type of keys, you can simply put the Assignment Mode and press on 'Delete' to delete all the assignations. To delete the keys individually, you can choose them and when you have to assign a new key, you press the 'Delete' key and it will delete the assignation.

You can change the visualization that you have of the piano with the arrows in the top. The simple arrows just move you from one note and the double arrows move you from one octave to the left or to the right. For this, you can also press the directionnal arrows on your keyboard. 
You also have the little visualization with which you can interact by dragging and dropping the selection part of the piano that you currently see. It will move the part of the piano that you see obviously. 

The notes are normally named by defaut with the MIDI visualization (C5, C#5, D5 ...), but you can switch with the Latin notes (Do, Do#, Re) with the button on the top, which is two circular arrows. And of course you also have the 'Insert' button. 

By default the notes are very ugly because you don't have the Sustain Mode. You can fortunately switch the Mode with the button in the top center, representated by the classic image of the Pedal. Oterwise, the keyboard key for that is 'Alt Right'.

## üõ†Ô∏è Details
At the little beginning the notes are not going to be playable because they are still charging. I put a Loading Screen fot that but it's a bit longer. I tried to add a timer to not can play during about 1 second but it doesn't really matter. This also happens when you leave and come back on the page. Just wait a good second and it will be alright !

I tried to do a responsive page (adapted to all the size of screens) but I don't really succeeded but it's normally roughly correct. I'm sorry but it will be hard to play on phone I think... or maybe if you turn the phone on the side ??

For the beauty of this project, I tried my best... It's just a piano, it didn't need to be THAT beautiful. I tried and I hope I succeeded to do it as beautiful as I can and normally, it's alright. You won't pay attention to this type of details... 

Unfortunately, it's in French, but there are not so many text so it won't be hard to understand (at least I hope).

The project has been finished the July 18th of 2024 after several hours of work (something like 30 - 40 hours I think (I was discovering JavaScript))
